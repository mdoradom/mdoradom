**Second Brain** is my personal blog, inspired by the **"Second Brain"** methodologyâ€”a knowledge management system that mimics how the human brain connects ideas. Instead of storing isolated pieces of information, this approach interlinks concepts like neurons forming a web of knowledge, making it easier to revisit, refine, and expand upon past learnings.

This blog serves as a structured repository where I document and connect insights from my journey in **game development and programming**. By continuously linking ideas and revisiting them over time, I create a system that helps reinforce learning and encourages deeper understanding.  

The site is built using **Obsidian**, my primary note-taking tool, and **Quartz**, a static site generator (SSG) designed for publishing interconnected markdown-based notes. Quartz was created by [Jacky Zhao](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), and its flexibility allows me to structure my notes in a way that closely follows the Second Brain methodology.
