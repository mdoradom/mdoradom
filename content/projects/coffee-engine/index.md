**Coffee Engine** is a small game engine made from scratch by **Hugo Planell Moreno** and **myself** as a personal and academic project, with the purpose of learning more in-depth about how game engines work.

This project started as a summer experiment and later became the foundation for the *Game Engine* course in the **third year** of the **CITM Game Design and Development Bachelor's Degree**. The project received the highest distinction in the course (*Matr√≠cula de Honor*), achieving a perfect score (10/10).

It was also selected as the **official engine** for the entire class to develop a game with **40 students** as part of the *Project 3* subject. The game is currently in development, and once it is released at the end of **Q2-2025**, I will update this post with more information.

The project is **cross-platform**, tested on **Windows and Linux**. macOS support is possible, but since we don't have Apple devices, it hasn't been tested.
