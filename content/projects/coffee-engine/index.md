**Coffee Engine** is a small game engine made from scratch by **Hugo Planell Moreno** and **myself** as a personal and academic project, with the purpose of learning more in-depth about how game engines work.

This project started as a summer experiment and later became the foundation for the *Game Engine* course in the **third year** of the **CITM Game Design and Development Bachelor's Degree**. The project received the highest distinction in the course (*Matr√≠cula de Honor*), achieving a perfect score (10/10).

It was also selected as the **official engine** for the entire class of **40 students** to develop a game as part of the *Project 3* subject. To learn more about that project, you can read the post about [Warhammer 40,000: The Last Marine](/projects/w40k-tlm/) here.
