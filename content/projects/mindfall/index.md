**Mindfall - The Last Threshold** is a psychological first-person shooter developed for the **8th Gran CITM Game Jam**, organized by **CITM UPC** with collaboration from **GAMELOFT**, **SOCIAL POINT**, **Larian Studios**, **Donestech**, and **Terrassa City Council** as judges. The game was created in just **7 days**, pushing our limits to create a fast-paced FPS gameplay with good atmospheric storytelling.

### Story & Atmosphere

The game follows the journey of a protagonist who, struggling with depression, attempts to take their own life. However, instead of an abrupt end, they find themselves trapped within the depths of their subconscious. Players navigate through surreal and chaotic environments, representing fragments of the protagonist's past, where they must confront their fears and anxieties.

- **A fast-paced FPS shooter** with tight movement and intense combat.
- **A unique visual approach**: Minimalist textures with a strong focus on lighting and post-processing effects to enhance the eerie atmosphere.
- **Enemy encounters** force players to adapt and fight their way through manifestations of the protagonistâ€™s fears.
- **A deep, oppressive atmosphere** that shifts as players progress, creating a sense of unease and urgency.

### Technologies Used
