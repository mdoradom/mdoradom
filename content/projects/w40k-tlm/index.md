**Warhammer 40,000: The Last Marine** is an isometric shooter focused on exploration and action. It was developed by a team of 40 students from **CITM-UPC** during the **Project 3** course, in a record time of **4 months**, using our own game engine: [**Coffee Engine**](/projects/coffee-engine/), written in **C++** and **OpenGL**.

> *Only one Ultramarine survived the drop â€“ Battle-Brother Quintus Maxillian. Alone. Outnumbered. Unbreakable.*

### My Contribution

Before starting this project, I was already working on the development of the [**Coffee Engine**](/projects/coffee-engine/). During the development of *The Last Marine*, my main responsibility was to expand and maintain the engine, adding key systems to facilitate game production. My tasks included:

- Development of the **physics module**
- Implementation of the **collision detection system**
- Development of the **prefab system**
- Development of the **Lua scripting system**
- Implementation of **static frustum culling with octrees**
- Reviewing *pull requests* to maintain code quality
- Performance optimization using *profiling* tools
- Maintenance of **Linux builds**, including compatibility with **Steam Deck** (performance, controller support, etc.)
- Technical documentation for the engine
