Hello! I'm **Mario Dorado Martínez**, a **22-year-old** video game developer, born in **Barcelona in 2002**. Video games have been a fundamental part of my life for as long as I can remember. My first experience with them was playing *Tomb Raider I and II* from **1996** on my grandfather's computer.

I've always had a computer at home, which allowed me to **tinker with technology** from a young age, sparking a curiosity that led me to study **Microcomputer Systems and Networks**, and later, **Multiplatform Application Development** at *Escola del Treball*. After completing those studies with a solid foundation in IT and programming, I decided to combine my two passions: **technology and video games**, and I enrolled in the **Bachelor's Degree in Game Design and Development** at *UPC*.

## Goals and Ambitions

My main goal is to **continue developing** as a programmer in the video game industry, constantly learning and improving. I'm passionate about any code related topic, where I can apply my technical skills.

One of my most recent interests is the programming language *Rust*, which draws my attention due to its **safety** and **performance**, and I believe it could have interesting applications in **game development**.

## Hobbies and Activities

When I'm not programming, I enjoy **playing video games**, but I also love **movies** and **reading**. I like to keep track of the games, books, and movies I consume, so feel free to check out my profiles:
