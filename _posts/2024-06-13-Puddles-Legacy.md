<p>Puddle's Legacy is a single-player real-time action role-playing game (RPG) set in a fantasy world. Sabrina must follow the footsteps of her missing father to fill a magical book of beasts by exploring very dangerous terrain. Will Sabrina manage to find her father in this adventure?</p>

<p>The game was developed for the Project 2 course as a collaboration between the Design and Development of Video Games degree and the Design, Animation, and Digital Art degree. Our team consisted of 10 developers from the video game degree handling the technical aspects, and 8 artists from the art degree responsible for the artistic aspects of the game like concepts, sprites or animations.</p>

<p>I worked alongside my teammate, Hugo Planell Moreno, in the role of Tech Team Leader and Programmer. We were responsible for organizing the team, integrating changes, and managing the implementation of features by all 18 team members. The game was developed over a period of 4 months.</p>
