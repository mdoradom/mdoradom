<p>Karoshi Dreams is a game developed for the 7th Gran CITM Game Jam, organized by CITM UPC with collaboration from GAMELOFT and SOCIAL POINT as judges. The game was created in just 5 days, exploring the Japanese term "karoshi" (death by overwork) within a surrealistic and dark atmosphere. The main theme of the jam was dreams and nightmares.</p>
