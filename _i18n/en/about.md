Hello! I'm **Mario Dorado Mart√≠nez**, a **22-year-old** video game developer, born in **Barcelona in 2002**. Video games have been a fundamental part of my life for as long as I can remember. My first experience with them was playing *Tomb Raider I and II* from **1996** on my grandfather's computer, where I spent hours locking the [butler in the freezer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW2zPX2nMcw) (yes, I was that person). Over the years, I've grown up playing series like *Minecraft*, *Zelda*, *Battlefield*, and other classics that shaped my passion for video games.

I've always had a computer at home, which allowed me to **tinker with technology** from a young age, sparking a curiosity that led me to study **Microcomputer Systems and Networks**, and later, **Multiplatform Application Development** at *Escola del Treball*. After completing those studies with a solid foundation in IT and programming, I decided to combine my two passions: **technology and video games**, and I enrolled in the **Bachelor's Degree in Game Design and Development** at *UPC*.

## Passion for Video Games

For me, video games are more than just entertainment. They are a unique way to **tell stories** and **create experiences** that can't be lived in any other medium. Ever since I played *Tomb Raider* on my grandfather's old computer, I knew I wanted to be a part of this world. Video games have an incredible power: not only do they let you **live stories**, but they turn you into the **protagonist**, make you **make decisions**, and feel like you're part of something greater.

## Goals and Ambitions

My main goal is to **continue developing** as a programmer in the video game industry, constantly learning and improving. I'm passionate about **low-level programming**, and I enjoy working on **game engine development**, where I can apply my technical skills.

One of my most recent interests is the programming language *Rust*, which draws my attention due to its **safety** and **performance**, and I believe it could have interesting applications in **game development**.

## Hobbies and Activities

When I'm not programming, I enjoy **playing video games**, but I also love **movies** and **reading**. I like to keep track of the games, books, and movies I consume, so feel free to check out my profiles:
